## Dataset Overview
This project processes a dataset containing financial news headlines and descriptions alongside corresponding timestamps. The analysis includes:
- Text patterns in news headlines and descriptions.
- Trends in the frequency of published articles.
- Predictive modeling using processed data.

## What Can This Repository Do?
### Key Modules:
1. **Data Overview**
   - Provides a summary of unique articles, missing data, and overall dataset structure.
2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Analyzes the frequency of news articles over time to identify significant trends.
3. **Text Pattern Extraction**
   - Extracts and visualizes word frequency patterns from news headlines and descriptions.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Leverages SpaCy NLP tools for deeper linguistic insights into the news data.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib spacy
```
Additionally, download the required SpaCy language model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
installation of fuzzywuzzzy

#### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset
Load the dataset containing financial news headlines:
```python
import pandas as pd
file_path = '/path/to/reuters_headlines.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display dataset overview
data.info()
data.head()
```

#### 2. Analyze Trends Over Time
Convert timestamps to datetime and plot article trends:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Time'], errors='coerce')
article_trends = data.groupby(data['Time'].dt.date).size()

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
article_trends.plot()
plt.title("Article Trends Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Number of Articles")
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

#### 3. Extract Text Patterns
Analyze word frequencies in headlines and descriptions:
```python
from collections import Counter
import re

def extract_word_frequencies(column, top_n=20):
    text = " ".join(column.dropna().astype(str)).lower()
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text)
    return Counter(words).most_common(top_n)

headline_word_freq = extract_word_frequencies(data['Headlines'])
print("Top Words in Headlines:", headline_word_freq)
```

#### 4. Perform Sentiment Analysis
Use SpaCy to perform linguistic analysis:
```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
text = "Sample financial news headline."
doc = nlp(text)

for token in doc:
    print(f"{token.text}: {token.pos_} ({token.dep_})")
```

---

## Results
- **Trends Over Time**: Identified significant time periods with increased article frequency.
- **Word Frequency Patterns**: Highlighted commonly used words in financial headlines and descriptions.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Provided linguistic insights to better understand news context.
